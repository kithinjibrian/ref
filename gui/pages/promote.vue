        <p>One of the easiest ways to begin generating an income is through the use of online marketing.</p>
        <h3>What is a referral link?</h3>
        <p>
            A referral link is a unique URL assigned to each user. The referral link contains the owner's ID, allowing the user to get credit for the traffic sent to this website. If a visitor clicks the referral link and registers an account and thereafter pays the initiation fee, we are obliged to pay your KES 750.

        <h3>
            Best methods of promoting your referral link.
        </h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h4>Facebook/Telegram/WhatsApp groups.</h4>
                <p>Recommend your referral link to other people in your facebook groups when applicable( if allowed).</p>
                <p>Always check with the group's admin that it is okay to use referral links. You can find that information in the info section of a group or in group's pinned post at the top of the group's feed.</p>
                <p>Make sure that if and when you recommend a referral link you aren't just pasting the link and running.</p>
                <p>Including an honest, thoughtful and heartfelt comment before you offer your referral link will usually result in higher conversions.</p>

            <li>
                <h4>Friends and family</h4>
                <p>Recommend your referral link to your friend and family if applicable.</p>
                <p>I know this is a no-no for a lot of you. It is also for me.</p>
                <p>I personally don't go out of my way to speak to any of my family and friends about my referral links.</p>
                <p>I do however passively promote it by posting it on my personal facebook profile or whatsapp status.</p>
